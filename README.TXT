So yeah… I tried porting DOOM to Windows with AI. Let’s just say the repo name isn’t lying. 😅

Heads up: you’ll still need your own DOOM WADs to actually run this. 

For legal reasons, this is strictly a DOOM MOD — no original WADs included.

and also it crashes if you stay on the menu screen too long
if you open automap with tab
basically anything i am way to scared to open this

its super unstable so UHHHHHH ok i guess

basically the same code base but like hit with a hammer a few times
